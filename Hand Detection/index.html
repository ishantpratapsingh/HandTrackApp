  <h3>As we are aware of the current COVID-19 situation, Coders and Gamers have a bad habbit of touching their face or biting their nails in stressful situations or while thinking. This is a bad practise in current pandemic situation when people are advised not to touch there face frequently. Just Run this application in a new Tab and continue with whatever you are upto (works fine even when it's in background) and it would help you eliminate this bad practise forever, warning you with a horn everytime you touch your face or bite your Nails.</h3>
