# HandTrackApp
HandTracking Application Build Using HTML,CSS and JS
During the times of this pandemic, Gamers and Competetive Programmers have a bad habbit of continously touching their or face or biting their nails.
Such practise is not safe in the times of pandemic and it is very diffult to let go this habbit as it persists for years.
So just to help you with this, I have created this application which would detect your hand as soon as you raise to touch your face or bite nails and a 
horn will be played as a warning.
Repetetive use of this application as an extra window in your browser will help you let go of this practise very easily.
Thus, I welcome you to try my app and check it  yourself.
Any contributions to the front-end are humbly appreaciated and you can modify it according to your own comfort.
Thanks.
